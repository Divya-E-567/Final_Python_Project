This project is a comprehensive data analysis of Global Life Expectancy, using World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2000 to 2015. It aims to identify which socio-economic and healthcare factors actually help people live longer.

The Goal: To understand why some countries have a higher life expectancy than others and to determine if factors like a country's wealth (GDP), education (Schooling), or immunization rates are the primary drivers of longevity.

Data Preparation (Data Cleaning): Before analyzing, the data was "cleaned" to ensure accuracy:

Missing Data: Large gaps in columns like Population and GDP were filled using the Median, ensuring that missing information didn't bias the results.

Outliers: Extreme values (anomalies) in mortality and economic data were managed using the IQR method so that rare, extreme events wouldn't distort the overall global trends.

Key Findings: Education is King: "Schooling" showed the strongest positive connection to a long life. More years of education lead to better health literacy and economic opportunities.
The Development Gap: There is a persistent 15-year gap in life expectancy between "Developed" and "Developing" nations.

Population Size Doesn't Matter: The analysis showed almost zero correlation between a country's total population and how long its citizens live. Large countries can be just as healthy as small ones.

Immunization Impact: High rates of Polio and Diphtheria vaccinations are critical "tipping points" for increasing a nation's average lifespan.

Final Conclusion: While a country's wealth (GDP) is important, it is not the only factor. The real drivers of a long life are Social Investments (Education) and Preventative Health (Vaccinations). The project proves that global health is improving, with the world average increasing by about 4-5 years over the 15-year study period.

Future Recommendation: Governments should focus on increasing mandatory schooling years and reaching 85%+ vaccination coverage, as these are the most cost-effective ways to rapidly increase national life expectancy.
